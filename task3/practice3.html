          The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
          scripting languages such as JavaScript.

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style
          (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents.These pages contain
          information on how to learn and use CSS and on available software.
          They also contain news from the CSS working group.

          JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
          compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is
          most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
          non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB
          and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
          single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
          imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
